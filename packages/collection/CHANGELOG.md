- make allowed file extension checks not be case sensitive

- remove DDP "/del" access point since it's not used or necessary

- Remove collection-hooks dependency; use deny instead. Also some cleanup and code docs

- replace `mmmagic` dependency with a `mime` dependency; hopefully fixes issues we've seen with meteor deploy

- use observes for all store saving and temp store deleting; add/adjust some api doc comments (didn't regenerate yet)

- improve fileIsAllowed check order and messages

- Add check for the Accounts package

- *Fixed bug:* "no userId passed to download allow validator" [#120](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS/issues/120)

- add security section

- Internally, change all "master" stuff to be the same as "copies". External API is still the same, but master options are copied to a special copy named "_master" so that all the other code can be cleaner. This may be a step toward being able to blur or eliminate the master/copy distinction, although there are still some benefits to having a master.

- complete refactoring; temporary for testing/tweaking and then will split into multiple packages
