- *Merged pull-request:* "Support for expiration token" [#1](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-cfs-access-point/issues/1) ([tanis2000](https://github.com/tanis2000))

- Switched to HTTP.call() to get the server time

- Better check for options.auth being a number. Check to see if we have Buffer() available on the server side. New check to make sure we have the token. Switched Metheor.method to HTTP.methods for the getServerTime() function.

- Expiration is now optional. If auth is set to a number, that is the number of seconds the token is valid for.

- Added time sync with the server for token generation.

- Added code to pass a token with a set expiration date from the client. Added token check on the server side.
